# RaceAgainstCOVID
MIT Datathon
Original data information can be found in the data sources file along with the BigQuery pull requests. Attached data is prepped with the Python file. The Los Angeles Data is based on buroughs and not zip codes with socioeconomic data derived from an averaging of all zip codes in an area and should be treated with caution. We hope that future information should become available for LA data to better understand the relationship between socioeconimic drivers and COVID 19 cases. We also recommend using 2020 census data in the future once it becomes available.
